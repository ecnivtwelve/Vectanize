# Vectanize
Open Figma Variants as an configurable file.

### Read this to understand how to export Figma Variants for Vectanize.
[Figma Tutorial](https://github.com/ecnivtwelve/Vectanize/blob/main/HowToFigma.md)

## What is this ?
In 2020, Figma introduced [Variants](https://www.figma.com/blog/bridging-design-and-code-with-variants/), a feature that allows components to have multiple states.
However, it became really hard to export and find which version of the component you needed to use.

## This is where it's useful.
Vectanize takes a *.zip* or a *.vsg* file that contains variants **exported from Figma**, reads them, and organizes them in an user interface that lets you easily
select which version you need right now.

## Other stuff

### About the user interface.
I know, it's kinda ugly rn. Don't worry, an all new user interface and dark mode is coming really soon.

### What the hell is a .VSG file ?
It's basically a .ZIP archive but it's not named as ZIP so you can point your operating system to open files with Vectanize directly.
